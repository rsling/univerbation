\section{Theoretical and descriptive background}
\label{sec:theoreticalbackground}

In this section, we lay the theoretical and descriptive foundations of our analysis of the alternation described in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}.
First, we clarify the status of spaces as syntactic boundaries in German in Section~\ref{sub:spaceswordsanduniverbation}.
Then, we discuss previous analyses of N+V units and their spelling, followed by the formulation of our predictions for the empirical studies, in Section~\ref{sec:thestatusofnounverbunitsingerman}.

\subsection{Spaces, words, and univerbation}
\label{sub:spaceswordsanduniverbation}

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, we use graphemic evidence from corpora and controlled experiments, and we argue that it indirectly allows us to draw conclusions about writers' cognitive grammars.
More specifically, we assume that compound spellings of N+V units indicate that writers conceive of those units as single syntactic words, whereas disjunct spelling indicates that they conceive of the unit as two syntactic words.
Therefore, we briefly introduce the status of the space in German writing and how it pertains to N+V units.

German writing uses an alphabetic script with a strong correlation between underlying phonological forms (the phonemic level) and characters (graphemes).
A common fundamental principle of such scripts is the separation of syntactic words by spaces \parencite[22]{Jacobs2005}.
Also, stems and their affixes are never separated from one another, which reinforces the status of the space as a demarcation of syntactic words.%
\footnote{There is a class of verbal particles which does not follow this principle.
Verbs like \textit{aufessen} (`eat up') formed from a verb stem (\textit{essen}) and a prefixed particle (\textit{auf}) are spelled as one word when they are adjacent in verb-last order, but they are separated in verb-second order where the verb is moved to sentence-second position and the particle remains in sentence-last position through obligatory long-distance movement (see \citealt{Hoberg1981} for an account of German clausal and sentential syntax).}
These factors facilitate the reader's ability to decode the sequence of syntactic words, and they constitute a crucial principle in the encoding and conventionalisation of meanings associated with word forms \parencite[22]{Jacobs2005}.

Unlike in English, German has regular compound spelling of syntactic words comprising more than one stem, especially for the case of the highly productive noun+noun (N+N) compound pattern (\citealt[182]{Fuhrhop2007}, \citealt[34]{Jacobs2005}, Section~\ref{sec:thestatusofnounverbunitsingerman} below), for which compound spelling is the dominant graphemic realisation.
However, there is a heterogeneous group of multi-word constructions for which only a tendency towards compound spelling can be observed (\citealt[95]{Szczepaniak2009}, \citealt[335]{Wurzel1998}).
As opposed to N+N compounds, these constructions typically consist of words with different parts of speech, such as \textit{mithilfe} (\textit{von}) (`with the help (of)') from \textit{mit der Hilfe} (\textit{von}) or \textit{zuhause} (`at home') from \textit{zu} \textit{Hause}.%
\footnote{Normative approaches as well as individuals display a lot of variation with respect to at least some of those constructions (cf.\ below).}
For such cases, \citet[206]{Lehmann2020} posits a ``downgrading of a syntactic to a morphological boundary'' between the two words.
When writers use compound spelling in these cases, they choose to encode the construction as a single word with a morphological boundary instead of a sequence of words with a syntactic boundary.
If many speakers consistently make this choice over a significant period of time, the unit might become lexicalised  as a single word \parencite[212]{Lehmann2020}.
Until such a diachronic process is complete and one of the spellings has become clearly dominant, the item alternates between a syntactic and a morphological realisation.
For many of these constructions, this is the case both in non-standard as well as standard written German, albeit to different degrees.%
\footnote{We are not aware of any published research systematically comparing the alternation tendencies in standard and non-standard written German.}

N+V units with different affinities towards compound spelling like \textit{Rad fahren} (`bike riding', often also spelled \textit{radfahren}) and \textit{eislaufen} (`ice skating', infrequently also spelled \textit{Eis laufen}) represent different levels of diachronic re-conventionalisation as single words.%
\footnote{The orthographic norm is notoriously unstable with respect to N+V units, which contributes to their unclear status.
Before the significant reform of the orthographic norm in 1996, both \textit{radfahren} and \textit{eislaufen} were supposed to be spelled as one word.
After the reform, both units were supposed to be written as two words (\textit{Eis laufen} and \textit{Rad fahren}).
After a revision of the reform in 2006, \textit{eislaufen} was again supposed to be spelled as one word, whereas \textit{Fahrrad fahren} was supposed to be spelled as two words exclusively (\citealt[32]{Primus2010}, \citealt[356]{Eisenberg2020a}).
From experience, we know that the norm is often not adhered to, and the data presented in Sections~\ref{sec:corpusbasedanalysisoftheusageofnvunits} and~\ref{sec:elicitedproductionofnounverbunitsinwrittenlanguage} strongly corroborate this experience.}
This indeterminacy means that speakers have both the syntagmatic realisation (disjunct spelling) and the morphological realisation (compound spelling) in their graphemic input, which subsequently leaves them with quite a free choice to be made based on how a concrete item is classified according to their individual grammar.
It is the task of usage-based probabilistic graphemics to uncover factors influencing such decisions and decode the principles at work in speakers' internal grammar by analysing their writing habits (see \concealed{\citealt{SchaeferSayatz2016}}).


\subsection{The status of noun+verb units in German}
\label{sec:thestatusofnounverbunitsingerman}

In Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, we showed that N+V units alternate between compound spelling and disjunct spelling when they occur in sequence.
In this section, we explain why the existence of this alternation is not surprising considering the morphosyntactic system of German.
Furthermore, we argue that in each concrete case where an N+V unit is written, the strength of the tendency towards either compound or disjunct spelling can be derived from the overall syntactic and morphological patterns available in present-day German.
These patterns are shown to have prototypical properties which are matched more or less well by individual N+V units and their syntactic contexts, which leads to either compound or disjunct spelling being the preferred realisation.%
\footnote{\citet{Huening2010} describes a similar alternation of Adjective + Noun constructions in Dutch and German.
He, too, argues that the respective constructions alternate between a syntactic and a morphological realisation, and he uses analogy to existing categories to explain the alternation.
While we opt for a prototype description, HÃ¼ning's view is still based on the same underlying assumptions as ours.}
The hypotheses put forward here are then evaluated empirically in Sections~\ref{sec:corpusbasedanalysisoftheusageofnvunits} and \ref{sec:elicitedproductionofnounverbunitsinwrittenlanguage}.

To this end, we will shed some light on the productive N+N compound construction in Section~\ref{sub:nncompounds} before turning to N+V units as reluctant compounds in Section~\ref{sub:nvunitsasreluctantcompounds}.
We sum up our arguments and derive our hypotheses for the empirical studies in Section~\ref{sub:hypothesesfortheempiricalstudies}.

\subsubsection{N+N compounds}
\label{sub:nncompounds}

For an N+V unit to systematically undergo graphemic univerbation (\ie a downgrading from a syntactic to a morphological construction in the sense of \citealt[206]{Lehmann2020}), it must resemble one or more established morphological constructions closely enough to be classified as an instance of such constructions itself.%
\footnote{Random isolated univerbations like \textit{zuhause} `at home' from \textit{zu Hause} are not systematic in this sense.
They are merely the result of idiosyncratic diachronic developments.}
We posit that this follows from the assumed underlying learning mechanisms under a usage-based perspective.
The prototypical and arguably the only fully productive morphological construction combining more than one stem in German is noun + noun (N+N) compounding, to which we turn now in some detail.%
\footnote{Adjectives also enter compounds as the head, such as in \textit{feuerrot} `red like fire', literally `fire red'.
However, this pattern is much less productive than N+N compounding, and we do not discuss it here.
See \citet[136]{Simunic2018} on the productivity of N+A compounds.}
German N+N compounds instantiate a proper morphological construction.
Syntactically, nothing can intervene in between the two stems of the compound, and they cannot be rearranged.
With minor exceptions (often exaggerated in normative discussions), they are also inseparable graphemically, \ie they are always written as one word \parencite[57--60]{Scherer2012}.
Furthermore, they are always head-final, mostly determinative, and they allow recursive formation wherein an N+N compound enters into another N+N compound, resulting in [[N+N]+N] or [N+[N+N]] structures \parencite[13]{FleischerBartz2012}.
Some examples are given in (\ref{ex:nncompoundsa}) and (\ref{ex:nncompoundsb}), the latter being recursively formed from the former.%
\footnote{If necessary, we present compound spelling with a minimal analysis of the morphological structure.
Affixes are separated from stems by hyphens, and lexical stems are separated from each other by a period.
Within compounds containing more than two stems, structure is shown using square brackets.}

\begin{exe}
  \ex\gll Haus.tÃ¼r\\
  house.door\\
  \trans front door\label{ex:nncompoundsa}
  \ex\gll Haus.tÃ¼r.schlÃ¼ssel\\
  [[house.door].key]\\
  \trans key to the front door\label{ex:nncompoundsb}
\end{exe}

The semantic relation between the first noun (\Ni) and the second noun (\Nii) is highly unspecific, rendering many compounds semantically ambiguous unless they are strongly lexicalised \parencite[252]{Klos2011}.%
\footnote{Obviously, once they are strongly lexicalised, they cannot help to establish a more canonical type of semantic relation between \Ni\ and \Nii, either, simply because lexicalised compounds are often intransparent to the language user \parencite[59]{Klos2011}, such as \textit{KammerjÃ¤ger} (`pest controller', literally `chamber hunter').}
The historic development of the stable N+N compound construction was furthered during the Early New High German period (approximately from the 14th to the 17th century AD) by a syntactic change.%
\footnote{\citet[130]{NueblingEa2017} find that the prenominal genitive begins to give way to the postnominal genitive in the 13th century.
Around 1500, already 53\% of the genitives are postnominal, rising to 64\% at around 1700.}
The dominant pattern of nominal attribution within the NP had been a prenominal genitive as in the now obsolete (\ref{ex:prenomgen}), which swiftly changed to a postnominal genitive as in (\ref{ex:postnomgen}).

\begin{exe}
  \ex[$\dagger$]{\gll des Hauses TÃ¼r\\
  {the\Sub{Gen}} {house\Sub{Gen}} door\\
  \trans the door of the house\\\label{ex:prenomgen}}
  \ex[ ]{\gll die TÃ¼r des Hauses\\
  the door {the\Sub{Gen}} {house\Sub{Gen}}\\
  \trans the door of the house\\\label{ex:postnomgen}}
\end{exe}

To the extent that prenominal attribution in syntax became more and more obsolete, the prenominal position was used to establish the highly productive morphological construction of N+N compounds as in (\ref{ex:nncompoundsa}) (see \citealt[132]{NueblingEa2017}, \citealt{Schluecker2012}), which showed a tendency to be written in compound spelling very early on \parencite[34--36]{DueckerSzczepaniak2017}.
The N+N compound construction is semantically at least as unspecific as the syntactic genitive construction to which it is diachronically related (\citealt[239]{Eisenberg2020a}).
Its recursive application is virtually unrestricted \parencite[504]{Wurzel1994}.
\Ni\ and \Nii\ are just concatenated as bare stems in most cases, but there are also so-called linking elements, which are sometimes positioned in between the stems.%
\footnote{A recent large-scale study \parencite[339]{SchaeferPankratz2018} showed that 60\% of all N+N compound types have no linking element, whereas 40\% have one of several possible linking elements.}
Diachronically, linking elements arise from diverse sources, but the overall pattern of inserting them is related to the former morphological marking in prenominal genitives \parencite[55--57]{NueblingEa2017}.

N+N compounds as described in this section are clearly the prototype for morphological constructions combining more than one stem in German.
In the next section, we show how N+V units deviate from this prototype, and how this keeps them from univerbating fully and stably.


\subsubsection{N+V units as reluctant compounds}
\label{sub:nvunitsasreluctantcompounds}

In this section, we argue that N+V units are \textit{reluctant compounds}.
Some factors pull away from compounding and univerbation, other factors pull them towards it.
While in principle the morphological N+V construction (as a kind of compound written as one word) has existed for centuries, we show that it remains in competition with a syntactic construction because it does not fit the morphological compounding prototype very well.
At the same time, we suggest why morphological compounding and consequently the spelling as one word (univerbation) become the preferred realisation under the right circumstances.

Most likely, full compounding of N+V units requires conversion of the verbal head to a noun, making the result an N+N compound via conversion.
As opposed to compounding with proper nominal heads (as discussed in the previous section), compounding with verbal heads is not a productive pattern in German.%
\footnote{\citet{Guenther1997} counts roughly 400 lexicalised N+V compounds in \citet{Muthmann1988} (see also \citealt[245]{Eisenberg2020a}).}
A major difference to N+N compounds is the fact that N+V units are usually not inseparable, as was already shown in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}.
There can be intervening material in between the noun and the verb in some contexts, namely the infinitival particle \textit{zu}.
This particle is, however, virtually part of the verbal word form and does by no means prevent univerbation (see example \ref{ex:compoundspelling4}, where \textit{radzufahren} is spelled as one word instead of \textit{rad zu fahren}).
Furthermore, in a verb-second sentence, the noun may remain at the end of the sentence in a structure reminiscent of particle verbs \parencite[603]{Fortmann2015}, see (\ref{ex:disjunctspelling1}).
This fact alone means that N+V units do not fit the compounding prototype anywhere near perfectly.
This likely introduces great resistance in speakers to classify them as compounds and use compound spelling.

Another major difference between N+N compounds and N+V units is that the morphological N+V construction is not recursive.
Nominalised N+V units marginally occur as \Ni\ in \Ni+\Nii\ compounds (contrary to claims by \citealt[54]{Fuhrhop2007}), as in (\ref{ex:notfuhrhop}).%
\footnote{The examples in (\ref{ex:notfuhrhop}) are attested and taken from the DECOW16B web corpus (see Section~\ref{sub:choiceofcorpussamplingandannotation}).
Their document frequencies are 218 for \textit{Energiesparmesse}, 416 for \textit{Endlagersuchgesetz}, and 414 for \textit{FeuerlÃ¶schboot} in a corpus of 17.1 million documents.
The document frequency is the number of documents the lemma occurs in, not counting multiple occurrences within each document.}
However, an N+V unit cannot function as the verbal head in another N+V unit (\ie a [N+[N+V]] structure) as illustrated in (\ref{ex:nnv}).
Native speakers will readily acknowledge that such constructions are absurd.

\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:notfuhrhop}\begin{xlist}
    \ex\gll Energie.spar.messe\\
    [[energy.save].fair]\\
    \trans trade fair for products useful in saving energy
    \ex\gll {Endlager.such.gesetz}\\
    {[[final~storage.search].law]}\\
    \trans law about the search for a permanent repository for nuclear waste
    \ex\gll Feuer.lÃ¶sch.boot\\
    [[fire.extinguish].boat]\\
    \trans fire-fighting boat
  \end{xlist}
  \ex[*]{\gll Rad.fahr.mach-en\\
  {[[bike.ride].make-\textsc{Inf}]}\\
  \trans make bike riding\label{ex:nnv}}
\end{exe}

We posit that the lack of core properties of prototypical (productive) German compounding constructions (separability, potential reordering, lack of recursive application) is a major factor in keeping the formation of N+V units from establishing a fully productive morphological compounding construction, thus keeping it from reliably requiring graphemic univerbation.

Another noticeable difference between the N+N and the N+V construction is the specificity of the internal relation.
While the relation in N+N compounds is quite varied, unspecified, and unspecific (see Section~\ref{sub:nncompounds}), there are only two possible relations within N+V units as we saw above, and these relations are determined by the verb's argument structure.
The relation is always either an argument relation, as in (\ref{ex:paraphrase-arg}), or an oblique relation, as in (\ref{ex:paraphrase-obl}).
These examples show that there is a syntactic paraphrase for N+V units (where, for the oblique relation, the noun occurs in a prepositional phrase that is an adjunct to the verb).%
\footnote{Pragmatically, these paraphrases might often be subject to blocking because of the availability of the N+V construction.
However, this does not make them syntactically or semantically unacceptable.}

\begin{exe}
  \ex\label{ex:paraphrase-arg}
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex\gll Kim will {(*eine} {Tasse)} teetrinken.\\
    Kim wants {(a} {cup)} {tea drink}\\
    \trans Kim wants to drink tea.
    \ex\gll Kim will (eine Tasse) Tee trinken.\\
    Kim wants {(a} {cup)} tea drink\\
    \trans Kim wants to drink (a cup of) tea.
  \end{xlist}
  \ex\label{ex:paraphrase-obl}
  \begin{xlist}
    \ex\gll Kim will die Corvette probefahren.\\
    Kim wants the Corvette test.drive\\
    \trans Kim wants to test-drive the Corvette.
    \ex\gll Kim will die Corvette zur Probe fahren.\\
    Kim wants the Corvette {to the} test drive.\\
    \trans Kim wants to test-drive the Corvette.
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

%The relation is decodable except in rare cases which underwent full lexicalisation such that the meanings of the lexemes or their distributions have changed significantly.
%However, both argument and oblique relations are prototypically realised in syntax as German is a language with a very weak (if any) tendency towards noun incorporation (see below in this section).
%Even if the verb is nominalised, direct objects are realised as genitives within the noun phrase, and adjuncts do not change their form when occurring within NPs containing nominalised verbs as heads.

This relation can be paraphrased for almost all N+V units.
The exceptions are the rare cases which have been lexicalised so fully that their meaning has changed significantly.
This means that the morphological construction marked by graphemic univerbation remains in competition with a syntactic construction with distinct syntactic words separated by spaces in writing.
This competition between a morphological construction and a syntactic construction was pointed out with varying terminology by---among others---\citet[12]{FleischerBartz2012}, \citet[13]{Schluecker2012}, and \citet[88]{Morcinek2013}.
Whereas the alternative syntactic construction for N+N compounds (the prenominal genitive) disappeared within a relatively short period of time, the ambiguity between syntax and morphology of N+V units remains intact.
This is true even though univerbation of N+V units with an argument relation dates back to Middle High German (\textit{lobpreisen} `praise', literally `to praise compliment') and even Old High German (\textit{hals-werf\=on} `turning around', literally `to throw neck'); see \citet[517]{Wurzel1994}, \citet[334]{Wurzel1998}.
For N+V units with an oblique relation, \citet[89]{Morcinek2013} notices that dictionaries from between 1750 and 1993 list novel N+V units with an oblique relation with increasing frequency.
For centuries or perhaps even more than a millennium, N+V units have been co-existing in syntax and morphology.
We assume that the stable availability of an alternative syntactic realisation is yet another major factor in preventing N+V formation from becoming a more clearly morphological construction in language users' cognitive grammars, making N+V units \textit{reluctant compounds}.

So far, we have focussed on the factors that speak against the compounding of N+V units.
We still have to show why and under which conditions true compounding and subsequent univerbation (including potential V-to-N conversion of the head and subsequent graphemic univerbation) are preferred.
As already mentioned, the morphological realisation of N+V units is a type of noun incorporation.
N+V units are usually seen as the only cases of potential incorporation in Modern German \parencite[245]{Eisenberg2020a}, which is why we argued above that argument and oblique relations are prototypically realised syntactically in the form of objects and adjuncts.
According to \citet[848]{Mithun1984}, incorporation is ``a particular type of a compounding in which a V an N combine to form a new V''.%
\footnote{From Mithun's types of noun incorporation, German N+V units clearly represent type 1 \textit{lexical compounding}.
Since this is highly straightforward and homogeneous, we do not discuss the literature on the typological classification of incorporation further.
Also, we do not take up the typological discussion on whether noun incorporation is a syntactic or a morphological process (\egg \citealt[414--421]{Haugen2015}, \citealt[923--925]{Mithun2000}).
We argue that N+V units in German clearly undergo a word-formation process when the noun is fully incorporated into the verb, and it's the alternation between syntax and morphology that is of particular interest to us.
Semantically, both cases (syntactic and morphological combination) have the same properties which are typical of incorporation.}
As \citet[848--849]{Mithun1984} points out, incorporation happens when the verb denotes a new and independent event concept in combination with the incorporated noun, and the semantics of the event is determined by the previous syntactic relation between the noun and the verb.
Typically, the noun loses its referential autonomy as well as its specificity, and it acquires a generic reading, which is indeed the case for N+V units.
In sentences like (\ref{ex:noreference}), no specific bike is referenced, and \textit{radfahren} refers to the whole concept of riding any bike.
This is true for both compound and disjunct spelling.

\begin{exe}
  \ex\gll Friedel kann {radfahren\slash Rad fahren.}\\
  Friedel can bike.ride\\
  \trans Friedel knows how to ride a bike. \label{ex:noreference}
\end{exe}

As a result of the semantic degradation of the noun, it looses its modifiability (also regardless of spelling), as illustrated in (\ref{ex:nomodifier}).

\begin{exe}
  \ex[*]{\gll Friedel kann schnelles Rad fahren.\\
  Friedel can quick bike ride\\
  \trans Friedel knows how to ride a quick bike.\label{ex:nomodifier}}
\end{exe}

Such losses of referential autonomy and syntactic combinatorics are referred to as `noun stripping' by \citet[287]{Gallmann1999}.
The loss of specificity and referential autonomy as well as the acquisition of a generic reading are part of the semantics of the N+V construction (see also \citealt[287]{Gallmann1999}, \citealt[108]{BredelGuenther2000}, \citealt[354]{Eisenberg2020a}).
Functionally, the construction exists in order to express the new event concept which requires the generic\slash unspecific reading of the noun.
Thus, the noun has the properties typical of nouns that are subject to incorporation of the lexical compounding type.
In contrast with the factors that prevent univerbation and make N+V units reluctant compounds, this is a factor that we assume to facilitate their univerbation.

In the next section, we will summarise the factors that influence the tendency of N+V units to undergo univerbation.
These factors will then be analysed in the empirical work to be reported in Sections~\ref{sec:corpusbasedanalysisoftheusageofnvunits} and~\ref{sec:elicitedproductionofnounverbunitsinwrittenlanguage}.

\subsubsection{Conclusions for the empirical studies}
\label{sub:hypothesesfortheempiricalstudies}

In the previous sections, we have laid out a theory of the factors favouring the univerbation of N+V units.
In this section, we summarise and describe the concrete effects that we expect to see in written production data based on our overall usage-based framework (see Section~\ref{sec:introduction}) and our theoretical assessment of N+V units.
These effects are then examined empirically in Sections~\ref{sec:corpusbasedanalysisoftheusageofnvunits} and~\ref{sec:elicitedproductionofnounverbunitsinwrittenlanguage}.

In general, greater similarity to the N+N compound prototype and reduced competition from the full syntactic realisation are expected to favour univerbation.
An important cue for this prototype is a strongly nominal morphosyntactic context.
Concretely, when the unit is embedded in an unambiguously verbal syntagma (\egg when the V head is an infinitive dependent on a modal verb or a participle dependent on an auxiliary), we expect a low tendency towards univerbation.%
\footnote{Notice that a finite V head would also create a prototypically verbal context.
However, in these cases, the N and the V are always realised discontinuously, and univerbation is not an option.}
However, when the unit occurs in a strongly nominal syntagma (\egg when the head is a fully nominalised head of an NP with a determiner), we expect a high tendency towards univerbation due to an accessible interpretation as an N+N compound.

The second important cue is the internal semantic relation.
N+V units with an oblique relation stand in weaker competition with a syntactic realisation compared with those that have an argument relation.
N+V units with an oblique relation would need more explicit marking with a preposition in the alternative (unambiguously syntactic) realisation.
%Also, for N+V units with an argument relation, there is the productive and functionally similar type of government compound of the form N\Sub{1}+N\Sub{2} where N\Sub{2} is obvtained from a verb by morphological derivation (\egg \textit{ProblemlÃ¶sung} `problem solving' where \textit{LÃ¶sung} is derived from the verb \textit{lÃ¶sen} `solve' with \textit{-ung} forming an action noun).
%However, there is no similar morphological pattern for units with an oblique relation.
%Hence, we expect a stronger tendency towards univerbation with oblique relations because they have a more accessible interpretation as a morphological unit (a compound) and at least a similar productive model construction in government compounds.

The univerbation of individual N+V units also involves very long-term diachronic processes of lexicalisation (see Section~\ref{sub:nvunitsasreluctantcompounds}).
While the individual lexicalisations are likely driven by the prototypicality effects described here, individual units might have progressed farther than others on the lexicalisation path.
Furthermore, when the compositional meaning of individual N+V units becomes less accessible, univerbation might be favoured as the semantics of the unit becomes more holistic.
Since philological investigations into the fate and semantics of each individual N+V unit are not feasible due to their sheer number, we will capture such individual tendencies numerically by comparing the frequencies of the units with or without univerbation in current usage (collexeme analysis).
The results of this analysis will be used to control for such effects in the experiment reported in Section~\ref{sec:elicitedproductionofnounverbunitsinwrittenlanguage}.

Finally, different speakers should be expected to have individual tendencies due to the variance in their input and in their compliance with normative advice.
While individual variation can rarely be controlled in corpus studies due to the lack of metadata identifying individual writers, it should be controlled and\slash or analysed in behavioural experiments.

At any rate, under a probabilistic usage-based view of language, all these factors are expected to influence univerbation non-deterministically.
Even in cases where all factors favour a realisation with univerbation, writers might sometimes spell it without univerbation and vice versa.
However, we expect such cases to be rarely found in usage data if the hypotheses put forward here correctly describe reality.
Our statistical models will be chosen appropriately for this assumption.
